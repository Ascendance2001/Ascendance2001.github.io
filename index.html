            <h2>The Clean Divorce</h2>
            <h3>in 2024 I woked on a project for the company "The Clean Divorce"</h3>
            <p> The Clean Divorce is a company based in Ontario who speciallizes in helping people go through Divorce. Such as giving them Medation sessions and similair. I, with 7 other people, remade their website from scratch using Wix.
                We chose Wix because of it's fast prototyping capablities and addon library allowing us to build common features such as the shop, or profile pages instantly so we can prioritize on the hard much more custom solutions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of these custom solutions is where I spent the most of my time. It's called Journey to Freedom. The idea of Journey To Freedom is to split up traditional medation sessions into small easily digestable chunks called stages 
                which a customer can go through at their own pace. This also saves them money as Journey to Freedom is much cheaper then these medation sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each stage is a single site which draws from a database to dynamically populate new content that includes videos and lots of very useful text based on a topic of a divorce. Each stage also has a "gratitude questionare" 
                at the bottom which is tracked then graphed when a customer makes it through all 8 stages of the Journey to Freedom.
